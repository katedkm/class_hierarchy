According to the Declaration of the human rights, has every person the right on these universal rights.
This means that states should protect people from abuses of the human rights.
However, in many states the government does not protect these rights; moreover, the government violates the them.
Even though almost every state has signed the Universal Declaration.
The discussion when there is a right to intervene is difficult; however, the United Nations (UN) should have the right to intervene in states which seriously abuses human rights, not only because the purpose of the UN is to protect the international security, but also because of the importance of the human rights.
One of the main reasons why the UN should have the right to intervene in a state which seriously violates the human rights, is because the purpose of the UN is to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security and human rights.
The violation of human rights in a state might lead to a threat to the international security and destabilize the neighbouring states because of the overwhelming influx of refugees.
This may pose a threat to the international peace; therefore, the UN should have right to intervene in certain circumstances.
